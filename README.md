# Spark-Innovators
Re-innovating the PowerBank by adding user authentication before discharge using the fingerprint sensor

This project was initialized using Platformio, a VSCode extension for Arduino board programming and other microcontrollers.
- To learn more about this extension -  [`Platfromio`](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)

## Getting Started with Arduino
- Install the `Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library` from the Arduino Library Manager
- Copy the updated Source code at `src/main.cpp`
